## Question 1

```{r}
grades<- read.csv(here("grades.csv"))
```

## Question 2

```{r}
data_question_2 <- grades|>
  summarise(
    minimum_grade = min(Exam, na.rm = TRUE),
    maximum_grade = max(Exam, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_grade = median(Exam, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_grade = mean(Exam, na.rm = TRUE))

kable(data_question_2, caption = "Several stats about the Exam dataset")
```

## Question 3

```{r}
missing_students <- sum(is.na(grades$Exam))
```

 The number of students who did not take the final exam is `r missing_students`

## Question 4

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())
ggplot(grades, aes(x=Exam))+
  geom_histogram(fill="red")
```

## Question 5

```{r}
number_of_students <- grades|>
  group_by(Group)|>
  summarise(`Number of students by group` = n())

kable(number_of_students, caption="Number of Students by group category")
```

## Question 6

```{r}
ggplot(number_of_students, aes(x=Group, y=`Number of students by group`))+
  geom_point(color="red")
```

## Question 7

```{r}
ggplot(grades, aes(x = Group, y = Exam)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "pink", color = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of the grades at the Exam conditioned by the group")

ggplot(grades, aes(x = Exam)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "pink", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of the grades at the Exam conditioned by the group") +
  facet_wrap(~Group)+
  ylab("Number of students")
```
